The idols of two Tirthankaras, namely Chandranatha and Mahaveera, are also kept inside the Kallu Basadi. On close observation, visitors can see an inscription on the base of the pedestal of the 24 bronze idols of Tirthankaras. This pedestal has been given the name Hari Peeta. Slate rock has been used for constructing the entrance (only the exterior part) of the Kallu Basadi. Travellers can also see the Saraswati idol (right side) and the Padmavathi Devi idol (left side) inside the sanctum sanctorum. Due to the presence of the above mentioned idols, the site is known as Ammanavara Basadi.Kallu Basadi, also known as the Black Basadi, is a historic Jain temple in Moodbidri. Constructed from black stone, the temple showcases remarkable craftsmanship and houses ancient Jain idols.
